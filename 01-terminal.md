# Prework - The Command Line

## Tasks
Working with Java and Android in this course will often involve interacting
with the terminal on our computers.

This pre-work will introduce you to some of the more common
commands involved in traversing directories and manipulating files on your
computer.

## Submitting Your Work
For each of the following segments of
[Bash Command Line Tutorials](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/)
on ryanstutorials.net, completely read through and complete each of
the activities in your own terminal. As you complete each segment's
activities, take a moment to document your learnings and observations.
