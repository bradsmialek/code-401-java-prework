## Pre-work

This is the mandatory pre-work for Code 401: Java. It will help you prepare
and familiarize yourself with tools we'll use during the course.
When this course nears its start date, you will be invited to an online
portal named Canvas where you can confirm that you've completed this prework
and claim credit.

Start on the pre-work as soon as you can and be sure to allow yourself plenty
of time to complete it. The prework should take you 10-12 hours to
complete, or much more if you need an extensive refresher on frontend web dev.
Allow yourself more time than you think you will need so that you
can take breaks and not get overwhelmed.

  * **Effective Java** is an excellent reference for Java fundamentals. The author
    offers in-depth explanations about how core language features work and
    offers advice about the best ways to use them. The Third Edition goes
    in-depth explaining many new modern Java features introduced in Java
    versions 7 and 8.

### Active Assignments
Having a level of comfort with the basic skills and tools youâ€™ll be using
every day is vital to your success. Work through the assignments and readings
listed below. Learn and research the language and its potential. For many of
you, this is a brand new language, and it is important for you to become
familiar with it and really understand the differences between Java and every
other language out there. Learn and determine why one would choose Java for a
project over another.

You do not need to do a lot of work every day. Spread it out evenly to do a
bit every day before the first day of class. Do not let a day go by without
spending your time practicing.
