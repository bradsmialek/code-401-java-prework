## Pre-work

This is the mandatory pre-work for Code 401: Java. It will help you prepare
and familiarize yourself with tools we'll use during the course.
When this course nears its start date, you will be invited to an online
portal named Canvas where you can confirm that you've completed this prework
and claim credit.

Start on the pre-work as soon as you can and be sure to allow yourself plenty
of time to complete it. The prework should take you 10-12 hours to
complete, or much more if you need an extensive refresher on frontend web dev.
Allow yourself more time than you think you will need so that you
can take breaks and not get overwhelmed.

### Set Up (2 hours)
#### Operating Systems:
This course supports Mac, Ubuntu and Windows users. All users must use the standard
setup for their system, as described in 201 & 301 prework. In particuluar, if you
use Windows, make sure you have the Windows Subsystem for Linux installed & set up
as described in [this guide](https://github.com/michaeltreat/Windows-Subsystem-For-Linux-Setup-Guide).

#### Editors and IDEs
We'll use a variety of text editors and IDEs to build our projects throughout
this course. We use **Visual Studio Code** for light text editing, **IntelliJ
IDEA** for pure-Java programs and **Android Studio** when we're building Android
applications. Additionally, you'll need to make sure **Java** itself is installed.

Download and install the following on your base OS:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition)](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/)
* [Java](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)

For WSL users, I also recommend installing Java on Ubuntu, so you can use the
`java` and `javac` commands.

#### Install Slack & Git
We use **Slack** to communicate with each other on a daily basis. We use **Git**
and **GitHub** for source control and collaboration.

* [Download Slack](https://slack.com/downloads/osx)
* Verify you have the [latest version](https://git-scm.com/downloads) of Git installed
* Setup an account on [GitHub](http://github.com) with a recent profile picture

### Optional Reference Materials:
* [Effective Java (3rd Edition)](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Bloch-Effective-Java-3rd-Edition/PGM1763855.html) 
  * **Effective Java** is an excellent reference for Java fundamentals. The author
    offers in-depth explanations about how core language features work and
    offers advice about the best ways to use them. The Third Edition goes
    in-depth explaining many new modern Java features introduced in Java
    versions 7 and 8.
* Obtain a [Seattle Public Library](https://www.spl.org/) card for free. You
  will have access to their e-book environment as well as free access to many
  Java and Android books.

### Active Assignments
Having a level of comfort with the basic skills and tools youâ€™ll be using
every day is vital to your success. Work through the assignments and readings
listed below. Learn and research the language and its potential. For many of
you, this is a brand new language, and it is important for you to become
familiar with it and really understand the differences between Java and every
other language out there. Learn and determine why one would choose Java for a
project over another.

You do not need to do a lot of work every day. Spread it out evenly to do a
bit every day before the first day of class. Do not let a day go by without
spending your time practicing.
